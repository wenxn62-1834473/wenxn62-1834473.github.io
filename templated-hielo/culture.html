								<p>BY CHLOE SCHAMA November 14, 2019</p>
								<h2>The Best Novels of 2019</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The year is not quite over, but we’re giving you a head start on your reading (and gifting) needs. From late-period le Carré espionage thriller to cult Instagram read, for every kind of fiction lover, here are the novels we loved in 2019.</p>

							<p>The End of Loneliness by Benedict Wells (Penguin Books, January)</p>

							<p>In an age when the double tap is so often the fastest path to fame, there is something appealingly old-fashioned about a literary success story. This holds especially true for the tale of Benedict Wells, the 34-year-old German wunderkind who survived a downright Dickensian childhood before emerging as a cultural sensation in his native country. Wells was only six when illness and financial troubles shattered his household, forcing his parents to send him to state-run Bavarian boarding schools. This early experience informs Wells’s überpersonal fourth novel, The End of Loneliness (Penguin Books), an international phenomenon that won the European Union Prize for Literature. The tale centers on the orphaned Jules and his two older siblings, following the trio through a series of events that are unfortunate but also joyful and funny. It is not a perfect novel, but it is a life-affirming work. As Jules says near the end, “I’m always surprised by how the light of memory makes particular moments shine brightly.” —Lauren Mechling</p>
